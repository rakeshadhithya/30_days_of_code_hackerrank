# 30 Days of Code (Python) â€“ HackerRank Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for HackerRank's [30 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) using Python.

## Structure

Each file is named as `dayXX_topic.py`, where:

- `XX` is the zero-padded day number (e.g., `day01`)
- `topic` describes the challenge

### Examples:

- `day00_hello_world.py`
- `day01_data_types.py`

## Daily Progress
